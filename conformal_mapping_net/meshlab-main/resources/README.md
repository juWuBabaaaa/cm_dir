# MeshLab resources

The `resources` folder contains a set of files, binaries and shaders that MeshLab needs to be correctly built, deployed and packaged.

Examples of contained files:
  - icons;
  - deployment software binaries;
  - configuration files for packaging;
  - shaders;
  - license, privacy and readme files that are bundled in the final MeshLab packages.
