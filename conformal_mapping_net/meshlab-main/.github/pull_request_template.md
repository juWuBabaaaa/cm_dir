## Thank you for sending a Pull Request to MeshLab!

On this repository, we keep two relevant branches:

- `main`: we keep here the **last release version of MeshLab**, with just bugfixes. In case of serious bugs caught after a release, this branch is used to publish "post-releases".
- `devel`: we add here new features and functionalities of the software that are going to appear in the next release of MeshLab. Bugfixes pushed in `main` are automatically merged on the `devel` branch.

Before submitting a PR, please check which branch suits better for your contribution!
